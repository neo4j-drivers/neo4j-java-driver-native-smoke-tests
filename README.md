# neo4j-java-driver-native-smoke-tests

This is a small project whose sole purpose is to build a native image from a simple application class depending on the 
[neo4j-java-driver](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver) with the help of [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org) and execute that 
binary against a Neo4j instance.

It ensures basic connectivity and functionality in two steps: Once with optional dependencies present, once with them being absent.

There's a small JBang Java script to orchestrate the tests.


## Build and run

### Start a Neo4j Docker instance

```
docker run --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 -e 'NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/secret' -e NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=yes neo4j:4.0
```

### Install GraalVM

Download the JDK 11 version for your operating system from
https://github.com/oracle/graal/releases

All community downloads are available on
https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases

Here we used version 21.3.0

Exports should be as follows:

```
export GRAALVM_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java17-21.3.0/Contents/Home
export PATH=$PATH:$GRAALVM_HOME/bin
export JAVA_HOME=$GRAALVM_HOME
```

Then install the native image tool

```
gu install native-image
gu list
```

### Build the project

```
./mvnw clean package 
```

It will automatically runs a test script against a Docker based instance. You can manually run the program against the above database with:

```
./target/printmovies
```

No movies will be printed as long as you didn't install the movie graph, but a query will have been made.

The script has as couple of options:

```
Usage: printmovies [-p[=<password>]]... [-a=<address>] [-l=<loggingLevel>]
                   [-m=<metricsAdapter>] [-u=<user>]
  -a, --address=<address>   The address this migration should connect to. The
                              driver supports bolt, bolt+routing or neo4j as
                              schemes.
  -l=<loggingLevel>         Logging level.
  -m                        Enables Micrometer Metrics.
  -p, --password[=<password>]
                            The password of the user connecting to the database.
  -u, --username=<user>     The login of the user connecting to the database. 
```
